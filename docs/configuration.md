# Configuration

Although microdoc touts itself as "zero config" — meaning that things will work without configuration — you'll need to set some basic options for a full experience.

Configuration options are set by defining a global `microdoc` object. If you're unfamiliar with JavaScript, that's the `var microdoc = {}` in the [starter template](getting-started.md#starter-template).

> **Tip:** When you're writing the config within inline `<script>` tags, keep in mind because the code is hand-written, you need to be mindful about cross-browser compatibility.
